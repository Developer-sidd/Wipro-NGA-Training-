Pseudocode Development - Task: Write a detailed pseudocode for a simple program that takes a number as input, calculates the square if it's even or the cube if it's odd, and then outputs the result. Incorporate conditional and looping constructs in simple terms


1. Start
2. Ask "Enter a number n"
3. Read inputNumber n and accept it
4. if (n%2==0) then
5. Set result = n * n (Square of the number)
6. else
7. Set result = n * n * n (Cube of the number)
8. end if
9. Display "Result: ", +result
10. End
